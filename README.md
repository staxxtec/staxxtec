- 👋 Hi, I’m James, currently studying frontend ( basically starting out from beginning and see what direction I
go in.)
- Passionate about technology and eager to expand my skills and learn more during this journey.
-  After having a career as an automotive tech, hoping to bring those skills I used to diagnose and repair to this field.
- 👀 Strong interest in both front-end/back-end and cyber security.  
- 💞️ I’m looking for ideas, projects, or advice, anything that can help me understand and learn much more.
- 📫
